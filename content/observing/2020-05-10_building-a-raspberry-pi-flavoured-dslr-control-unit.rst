Introduction
++++++++++++

.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

As well as the telescope pier I like to have a DSLR (an astro-modified Canon EOS
450D) on a Skywatcher Star Adventurer mount around in the garden. It makes for a
nice little mobile arrangement that can be set up at a moment's notice. Usually
the set up consists of the camera, a lens warmer, power for the mount and an
intervalometer for controlling the timing of pictures being captured.

Having really enjoyed setting up a `Raspberry Pi 4`_ running `KStars`_, `EKOS`_
and `INDI`_ for the pier based telescope I thought that putting a 'one stop'
solution together, able to do the same as the above plus a few extras, for the
DSLR would be a great little side project.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

There are a few little limitations that I like to be able to overcome with the
current DSLR set up.

Battery life on the DSLR is pretty short usually, and getting shorter as the
battery ages. I am currently getting about three to three and a half hours. To
do longer star trails and so on, ideally I would like that limitation to go
altogether.

The mount and heater are powered with a portable battery, and again diminishing
battery life proves to be a bit of an issue.

Lastly, a minor point; messing about with SD cards or plugging the camera into
a laptop to get the images. It would be nice to be able to do that remotely
without wires or carrying cards about.

Requirements
++++++++++++

I decided that the control box would have to be able to fulfil the following
requirements:

- Provide power for the DSLR, lens warmer and Skywatcher mount
- Download image data from the DSLR to local storage
- Be able to send data over my local network (WiFi or ethernet) via a shared
    drive or something similar
- Be powered from a 12 V power supply
- Perform the above tasks reliably and ideally in a single, and reasonably
    weather-proof package

With the above in mind I built up a list of things that would have to be
purchased to start the project, namely:

- Raspberry Pi Model 4B
- 32 Gig SD Card
- IP66 Project Box
- 1 x short USB C lead (Pi power supply)
- 2 x Mini USB leads
- 1 x USB to 7.1 V Canon power pack
- 1 x 5 V / 5 A 4 port USB power supply, stepping down from 12 V + (sold in
  pairs)
- 5 V 40mm cooling fan

So with a some time to spare, I hit a well known auction site and did some
shopping with the exception of the Raspberry Pi which came from my usual
supplier `RS online`_.

Plan
++++

The overall idea for the box is that it is supplied power via a 12 V DC and has
the ability to be connected to my local network via Ethernet. Why not WiFi, you
might ask? I have never had really trouble-free operation with discrete devices
running on WiFi; in other words, once they become unresponsive for some reason
one ends up having to walk to where they are and plug them in. Being wired in
just eliminates a frequent source of problems as far as I am concerned.

An ethernet connection and a 12 V supply can be achieved over a single cable as
`shown further down`_.

Construction
++++++++++++

The build took only a few hours once all the bits that I needed had arrived.
Post being what it is at the moment (COVID-19 times) I had to wait a few weeks
rather than a few days, but never mind... keeps one in suspense! The Raspberry
Pi and USB power supply

Power and Network on a Single Cable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, it's possible! As long as you are not after gigabit transfer speeds from
the control box to somewhere else on your network; not a problem for me!

Use of sending power down 4 redundant lines in Ethernet.

You can probably see that there are a couple of spare pairs of wires...

Testing
+++++++

Network issues where the Pi won't connect. Aha, /etc/rc.local needs editing with
an :bash:`ethtool` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Limit net adapter speed to less than gigabit
    ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full autoneg off

So it goes awry here when I start to connect all the bits. Low voltage causing
the Pi to reset.

*Up and running in the garden*

Overnight Problem - Random Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So I decided to run an overnight test by setting up a sequence of 120 frames,
120 seconds each. Set the session running before bed and left it going by itself
until the early hours. Waking up and checking the drive contents the following
morning it becomes apparent that the Pi has rebooted itself at some point; only
93 frames had been taken and the uptime on the Pi was less than three hours.

The first step was to take a look at some system logs on the Pi. As it turns out
I was lucky with my first strike - the kernel log at :bash:`/var/log/kern.log`:

.. code-block:: bash
