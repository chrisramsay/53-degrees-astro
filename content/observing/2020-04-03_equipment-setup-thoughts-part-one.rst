Introduction
============

.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

Setting up a new telescope is not an easy task. It takes some planning and
thought to get the set up right first time. I have made an attempt to plan out
everything that I will need before getting started. Using a handy copy of Visio
I had lying about I have put together a handful of block level diagrams to help
me out. This process gives me an overview of what is needed to make sure that
the system is complete and that everything has been thought of, as far as
possible. Following is a run through of my plans and my thoughts regarding what
issues they raised.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The basic idea was always that the telescope would be automated as much as
possible. The extent of the automation was that I would be able to put together
an imaging session or two and set it running, all from the comfort of the house,
via a remote desktop connection to an on board computer. In this case I consider
an imaging session to be: target (re)acquisition, focus, capture a set of lights
via a combination of filters, occasionally re-focus depending on temperature,
take care of meridian flips if necessary, and finally shut down when the session
is complete.

For the (computing) brains behind the operation, a RaspberryPi 4 was always the
goal, being that they are small, have reasonably low power requirements and run
on Linux, an operating system I am truly comfortable with.

Block Level Diagrams
====================

As can be seen, I started by preparing some block level diagrams to assist in
mapping out the entire telescope set up. The system was divided into multiple
systems and blocks divided on what the modules are transmitting from block to
block. The imaging train transmits photons between blocks, so that seemed like
a pretty obvious place to start:

Imaging Train
+++++++++++++

So this is how the image capture part of the set up currently looks. The photo
below was taken whilst I was checking the back focus from the Skywatcher field
flattener; it has to be 75 mm from a particular point on the flattener to the
CCD chip surface, give or take a small amount to account for the refractive
index of the filters.

As is apparent in the photo above, I'd not yet added the off axis guide camera
(OAG) to the set up. That will happen once I have the main imaging camera
properly focused. From right to left, the image shows the Skywatcher field
flattener, a custom made 15 mm spacer, a Starlight Xpress Loadstar 2 camera
mounted onto an off axis guider assembly, 7 position filter wheel and finally
the Starlight Xpress CCD imaging camera. The interfaces between the rear face of
the field flattener and the front face of the OAG / filter wheel are male M62
thread and male T-thread (42 mm) respectively, necessitating a custom made
spacer beautifully created by John at `J-Tech Design`_.

Once everything was together it was time to get drawing. Below is a plan of just
the imaging train as above with the light path show with blue arrows. Not much
in itself, but makes sense once it's part of the rest of the plan.

Overall Block Plan
+++++++++++++++++++

Next was to try and understand just how many cables would be needed, what type
and what sort of lengths. Also, each piece of the puzzle has different types of
USB connections. Thankfully everything that requires 12 V has the same, centre
positive 5.5 mm by 2.1 mm connectors. That definitely made life easier!

Additionally, the plan below helped me to make sense of what was needed for both
power distribution and USB connections. Once everything is laid out, it starts
to become obvious where things are missing, such as: I need to think about
getting a powered USB hub, or, do I have enough USB A to USB B leads?

The block plan also made sure that I did not forget about getting power to the
Raspberry Pi 4; these latest models are now powered via a USB C connector. The
initial plan for this was a step down converter from 12 V to 5 V and then
somehow butcher a USB-C lead to provide the power to the Pi. Other options I
considered were, for example, sending 5 volts via the header pins (unfortunately
bypassing some current protection devices in the process).

USB Connections
+++++++++++++++

From the overall plan I subsequently extracted the devices with a USB connection
and any associated USB cable. This lead me to my first thought with the USB
layout... I needed a powered USB hub, and hence power to run the hub itself. I
would ideally need to find a hub that would run from a 12 V supply (and in a
really ideal world, a 5.5 x 2.1 centre positive power feed!) to try and keep the
amount of adaptations down to a minimum.

Thankfully I have a habit of hoarding old cables and connectors that come with
electrical items purchased over the years. This came in useful as I was able to
find many USB A to B leads, of varying lengths, as required for the cable layout
on the telescope.

Power and Network
