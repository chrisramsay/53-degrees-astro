Introduction
============

.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

Setting up a new telescope is not an easy task. It takes some planning and
thought to get the set up right first time. I have made an attempt to plan out
everything that I will need before getting started. Using a handy copy of Visio
I had lying about I have put together a handful of block level diagrams to help
me out.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Block Level Diagrams
====================

Below I have prepared some block level diagrams to assist in my cabling the
entire telescope set up.

Imaging Train
+++++++++++++

So this is how the set up currently looks. The photo below was taken whilst I
was checking the back focus from the Skywatcher field flattener; it has to be
75 mm from the flattener to the CCD chip surface, give or take a small amount to
account for the refractive index of the filters.

As is apparent in the photo above, I'd not yet added the off axis guide camera
to the set up yet. That will happen once I have the main imaging camera nicely
focused.

Once everything was together it was time to get drawing. Below is a plan of just
the imaging train as above with the light path show with blue arrows. Not much
in itself, but makes sense once it's part of the rest of the plan.

Overall Block Plan
+++++++++++++++++++

Next was to try and understand just how many cables would be needed, what type
and what sort of lengths. Also, each piece of the puzzle has different types of
USB connections. Thankfully everything that requires 12 V has the same, centre
positive 5.5 mm by 2.1 mm connectors. That definitely made life easier!

Additionally, the plan below helped me to make sense of what was needed for both
power distribution and USB connections. Once everything is laid out, it starts
to become obvious where things are missing, such as: I need to think about
getting a powered USB hub, or, do I have enough USB A to USB B leads?

The block plan also made sure that I did not forget about getting power to the
Raspberry Pi 4; these are now powered via a USB C connector.
