Introduction
============

.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

Setting up a new telescope is not an easy task. It takes some planning and
thought to get the set up right first time. I have made an attempt to plan out
everything that I will need before getting started. Using a handy copy of Visio
I had lying about I have put together one or two block level diagrams to help
me out.

Imaging Train
=============

So this is how the set up currently looks. The photo below was taken whilst I
was checking the back focus from the Skywatcher field flattener; it has to be
75 mm from the flattener to the CCD chip surface, give or take a small amount to
account for the refractive index of the filters.

As is apparent in the photo above, I've not yet added the off axis guide camera
to the set up yet. That will happen once I have the main imaging camera nicely
focused.

Once everything was together it was time to get drawing. Below is a plan of just
the imaging train as above with the light path show with blue arrows.
