.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

This article chronicles the process of building a permanent astronomy telescope
pier in my garden. A permanent pier makes the setting up process for an night of
astrophotography or visual observing far less laborious. This is because the
pier is already aligned with the celestial pole, via the North peg on top of the
mount adapter. Power and network adapters are immediately to hand, removing the
hassle of laying cables out from the warm room and putting them away later
after.
