Introduction
============

.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

This series of articles will chronicle the process of building a permanent
astronomy telescope pier in my garden. A permanent pier makes the setting up
process for an night of astrophotography or visual observing far less laborious.
This is because the pier is already aligned with the celestial pole, via the
North peg on top of the mount adapter. Power and network adapters are
immediately to hand, removing the work of laying cables out from the shed and
putting them away later after each observing or astrophotography session.

Cutting the Turf
================

Well, I had to start somewhere, so I decided to cut a trench to the site of the
pier as my first step.

The trench is approximately 50 cm deep, keeping the cables far enough
underground to be out of the way of anything that might happen in the garden.
Thankfully the ground here is light soil and rock-free, therefore quite easy
to cut into.

Installing the Cabling
======================

The next step was to get some cables into the ground. I acquired some red
polypropylene cable conduit, with an inside diameter of approximately 27 mm to
act as a waterproof path for the cable from the shed to the pier.

The conduit carries three separate cables: a 3.0 mm\ :sup:`2` 33 Amp twin core
12 volt automotive cable, a 2.5 mm\ :sup:`2` twin and earth 240 VAC mains cable
and a Cat 5e network cable. These will all break out into waterproof enclosures
mounted on the side of the pier.

As can be seen in the picture above I had to cut a trench into the path at the
side of the shed to get the cables into the building where the services are.
Being that the concrete was old (25 years +), it was very hard and took a long
time to get through.

The cables enter the shed via a waterproof electrical box. This will make access
to the conduit easier should I need to add another cable one day; highly
unlikely, I think. Having the box there also avoids having to make a difficult
90° turn from under the path into the brickwork.

At the other end of the conduit lies the pier site itself (of course!). At the
moment there is just a large hole ready for the concrete pour and a lintel where
the base of the pier will fit. The conduit emerges near the base of the pier
site and it will then turn 90° in an upwards direction, going up inside the pier
in order to break out near the top.
