.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

I never thought that I would be starting an article containing the
statement "moving from Linux to Windows", but this is exactly what
will be happening with my main imaging scope set up in a few days.
For those who don't know anything about me, I have spent decades...
(hmm, yes it is now measurable in decades!) using Linux based operating
systems - since the early `Red Hat`_ days of the late 1990's, and being
comfortable with that environment, it has always been the first port of
call for any home project, such as a telescope mounted observation
control platform.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

* Windows software more widely used, SGP Pro, N.I.N.A.?? Try :)
* Multiple issues with EKOS - corrupt DB, crashes, terrible UI, polar align tool
* Bye bye Pi, hello mini PC
