.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

It has been a strange couple of months, what with the current Coronavirus
epidemic raging around us, but I have managed to capture a few astronomical
events from the garden in any case. So here begins the April 2020 roundup.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

ISS Passes
++++++++++

The `International Space Station`_ has made a number of bright passes in the
evening skies for the last few weeks.

*ISS pass with clouds and trees, taken 2020-04-01*

Low ISS pass taken 2020-04-01 at 20:36:38 UT on a (static) tracking mount. It is
an 82 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified Canon EOS 450D and an
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 400. As can be seen the stars have trailed due the
static mount, however a constellation can still be seen; `Orion`_ appears in the
right hand half of the frame, complete with the very bright `Orion Nebula` (M42)
making a fuzzy patch just above the electricity cables.

*ISS passing through Taurus with the Pleiades (M45), taken 2020-03-26*
|nbsp|

This is a 90 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified EOS 450D and a
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 800 with a polar aligned mount tracking at Sidereal
rate. In the top right corner of the frame is the `Pleiades open star cluster`_
(M45), also known as the Seven Sisters. The path of the ISS itself goes just to
the left of the red giant `α Tauri, Aldebaran`_ which is the brightest star in
the constellation Taurus. The stars scattered in and around Aldebaran are known
as the `Hyades`_, one of our closest open clusters, at approximately 153 ly
distant.

The Moon
++++++++

In March this year I purchased a well loved Samyang 135mm T2.2 lens which gives
me a 9°24.00' by 6°16.50' view of the sky with the Canon EOS 450D. I decided
that some moon shots would be a great way of giving it some first light.

I quickly set up in the garden for the above picture of the moon with the express
hope of capturing some `earthlight`_.

Lyrid Meteor Shower
+++++++++++++++++++

This year I decided to have an attempt at getting a picture or two from the
annual `Lyrid meteor shower`_; capturing a meteor is something I have never
tried before. The obvious solution seemed to be to aim a camera at or around
the radiant area in the sky around the `constellation of Lyra`_.

It was time to bring out the F3.5/8 mm UMC Fish Eye lens and have a few hours
under the stars. I decided to put the camera (Canon 450D astro-modified) onto
the Skywatcher Star Adventurer mount in order to track at Sidereal rate. Some
test pictures were taken initially, mainly to test various exposures, times and
angles on the sky.

Night 1 - 2020-04-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a single exposure, taken from a series of test exposures, 120 seconds
at ISO 800. Stacked using `Deep Sky Stacker`_, finished off using
`Affinity Photo`_ in black and white.

    <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/53-degrees-astro/49840695722/in/dateposted-public/" title="Lyrid Meteor bursts in Leo, taken 2020-04-21 at 22:21:06 UT"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49840695722_b73200116d_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="Lyrid Meteor bursts in Leo, taken 2020-04-21 at 22:21:06 UT"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

*Lyrid Meteor bursts in Leo, taken 2020-04-21 at 22:21:06 UT*

The wide angle lens takes in the long track of the meteor rather well; the
track stretches from the constellation of Boötes, right across Coma Berenices
and into Leo where it finishes in a flash.

Happy with the tests, I set up for a series of exposures aimed at capturing the
post midnight peak - starting from midnight to 0300. The session consisted of
100 files at 120 seconds each when complete. Not a single frame had captured a
meteor.

Night 2 - 2020-04-22
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following night was clear again, so another attempt was made at capturing
meteors. Once again the camera was set up with the fish eye lens, however this
time I started a little earlier due to some incoming cloud later on in the
night. This nights' session ran a series of 102 exposures at ISO 800, 120
seconds each, from 2236 to 0236 the following morning.

This night proved to be moderately more successful with two meteors captured.
neither were awe-inspiring, but I was happy with having at least something
at the end of the session.

So you have to look quite hard to see this first one (picured above), just to
the right of centre of the frame, making its way through the constellation of
Coma Berenices.

*Lyrid meteor in Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, 2020-04-23 at 00:25:10 UT*

The second capture took place the other side of midnight, streaking a 26° long
line between the stars of Alkaid (η UMa) and Kochab (β UMi). The image above has
been cropped quite significantly and changed to black and white from a colour
exposure using `Affinity Photo`_.

That was it for the Lyrids this year; quiet and nowhere near as exciting as it
could have been, but it does seem that most meteor hunters had a similar
experience. Roll on the next meteor shower.

Star Trails
+++++++++++

Having recently got hold of a fish eye lens I thought that it would be
interesting to leave the camera pointing at the sky, take a series of reasonably
long exposures and stack them together to generate some star trails. Being that
the stars move approximately 15° per hour, it made sense that even a short
amount of exposure time would produce some reasonable star trails.

*Back Garden Star Trails 2020-04-16*

This first image comprises 30 exposures of 60 seconds each, at ISO 400, using
the Canon EOS 405D with the F3.5/8 mm UMC Fish Eye lens.

*Looking for Lyrids 2020-04-20*

This second image is a composite of 120 exposures at 120 seconds each, ISO 800
from one of my attempts to capture meteors during the Lyrid meteor shower. No
meteors imaged, but a good set of star trails nevertheless.
