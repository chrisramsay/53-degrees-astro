.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

It has been a strange couple of months, what with the current Coronavirus
epidemic raging around us, but I have managed to capture a few astronomical
events from the garden in any case. So here begins the April 2020 roundup.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

ISS Passes
++++++++++

The `International Space Station`_ has made a number of bright passes in the
evening skies for the last few weeks.

Low ISS pass taken 2020-04-01 at 20:36:38 UT on a (static) tracking mount. It is
an 82 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified Canon EOS 450D and an
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 400. As can be seen the stars have trailed due the
static mount, however a constellation can still be seen; `Orion`_ appears in the
right hand half of the frame, complete with the very bright `Orion Nebula` (M42)
making a fuzzy patch just above the electricity cables.

*ISS passing through Taurus with the Pleiades (M45), taken 2020-03-26*
|nbsp|

This is a 90 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified EOS 450D and a
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 800 with a polar aligned mount tracking at Sidereal
rate. In the top right corner of the frame is the `Pleiades open star cluster`_
(M45), also known as the Seven Sisters. The path of the ISS itself goes just to
the left of the red giant `α Tauri, Aldebaran`_ which is the brightest star in
the constellation Taurus. The stars scattered in and around Aldebaran are known
as the `Hyades`_, one of our closest open clusters, at approximately 153 ly
distant.

The Moon
++++++++

In March this year I purchased a well loved Samyang 135mm T2.2 lens which gives
me a 9°24.00' by 6°16.50' view of the sky with the Canon EOS 450D. I decided
that some moon shots would be a great way of giving it some first light.
