.. PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY

It has been a strange couple of months, what with the current Coronavirus
epidemic raging around us, but I have managed to capture a few astronomical
events from the garden in any case. So here begins the April 2020 roundup.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

ISS Passes
++++++++++

The `International Space Station`_ has made a number of bright passes in the
evening skies for the last few weeks.

Low ISS pass taken 2020-04-01 at 20:36:38 UT on a (static) tracking mount. It is
an 82 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified Canon EOS 450D and an
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 400. As can be seen the stars have trailed due the
static mount, however a constellation can still be seen; `Orion`_ appears in the
right hand half of the frame, complete with the very bright `Orion Nebula` (M42)
making a fuzzy patch just above the electricity cables.

*ISS passing through Taurus with the Pleiades (M45), taken 2020-03-26*

This is a 90 second exposure at f/3.5 with an astro-modified EOS 450D and a
EF50mm f1.8 II lens, at ISO 800 with a polar aligned mount tracking at Sidereal
rate. In the top right corner of the frame is the `Pleiades open star cluster`_
(M45), also known as the Seven Sisters. The path of the ISS itself goes just to
the left of the red giant `α Tauri, Aldebaran`_ which is the brightest star in
the constellation Taurus. The stars scattered in and around Aldebaran are known
as the `Hyades`_, one of our closest open clusters, at approximately 153 ly
distant.

The Moon
++++++++

In March this year I purchased a well loved Samyang 135mm T2.2 lens which gives
me a 9°24.00' by 6°16.50' view of the sky with the Canon EOS 450D. I decided
that some moon shots would be a great way of giving it some first light.

Lyrid Meteor Shower
+++++++++++++++++++

This year I decided to have an attempt at getting a picture or two from the
annual `Lyrid meteor shower`_; capturing a meteor is something I have never
tried before. The obvious solution seemed to be to aim a camera at or around
the radiant area in the sky around the `constellation of Lyra`_.

It was time to bring out the F3.5/8 mm UMC Fish Eye lens and have a few hours
under the stars. I decided to put the camera (Canon 450D astro-modified) onto
the Skywatcher Star Adventurer mount in order to track at Sidereal rate. Some
test pictures were taken initially, mainly to test various exposures, times and
angles on the sky.

Below is a single exposure, taken from a set of test shots, 120 seconds exposure
at ISO 800. Stacked using Rendered in black and white
